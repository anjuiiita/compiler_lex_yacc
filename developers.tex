\subsubsection*{main.c}
There are 5 modes for this project as mentioned below: \\
Valid modes: \\
-0: Version information \\
-1: Part 1 Token Analyzer \\
-2: Part 2 (not implemented yet) \\
-3: Part 3 (not implemented yet) \\
-4: Part 4 (not implemented yet) \\

{\it Date Structure:} for part 0, I used fstream library to open and read from file. \\
Only mode 0 is impletemented in this file which gives the information about auther, version and date. \\
For Part 1, flex is used to tokenize the input file.

\subsection*{lexer.l}
This file defines the rules to tokenise the input file.

\subsection*{tokens.h}
This file contains tokens defined in the rules section of flex file\\

\subsection*{lex.cc.c}
This file is autogenerated from lexer.l and tokens.h file

\subsection*{Makefile}
This file will produce an executable named "mycc". \\
And also run the developers.tex file and generate developers.pdf file. \\
This also cleans the auto generated files. \\

\subsection*{Readme.md}
This file explain how to build the compiler and run it. \\
For part 0, only mode 0 is implemented which gives information about the author, version and date. \\
For Part 1,  mode 1 is implemented where flex is used to tokenize the input file. \\
$\#$include is implemented.
If there is error opening include file, error is genrated and if a cycle if detected then also Error is generated at max depth 256. \\

$\#$define is also implemented, if the defined var is a keyword, it generates approriate erroe message and also checks the length of replacement text and appropriate error is generated. \\

$\#$ifdef, ifndef, else, endif mismatched detection is implemented.
And if indentifier if not defined,  error is generated.
