There are 5 modes for this project as mentioned below: \\
Valid modes: \\
-0: Version information \\
-1: Part 1 (not implemented yet) \\
-2: Part 2 (not implemented yet) \\
-3: Part 3 (not implemented yet) \\
-4: Part 4 (not implemented yet) \\

{\it Date Structure:} for part 0, I used fstream library to open and read from file. \\
Only mode 0 is impletemented in this file which gives the information about auther, version and date. \\
\subsection*{Makefile}
This file will produce an executable named "mycc". \\
And also run the developers.tex file and generate developers.pdf file. \\
This also cleans the auto generated files. \\

\subsection*{Readme.md}
This file explain how to build the compiler and run it. \\
For part 0, only mode 0 is implemented which gives information about the author, version and date. \\
